  aboutParaZero:
    "At the Intersection of Design and Technology üìç",
  aboutParaOne:
    "Hello, I'm Kevin Stephens ‚Äì a digital alchemist where creativity meets code.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "With a palette that includes both pixels and algorithms, I craft digital experiences that are not just visually stunning, but intelligently functional. My journey began in the halls of Parsons School of Design, where I honed my eye for aesthetics and strategic thinking. But my curiosity didn't stop there ‚Äì I dove headfirst into the world of computer science, currently pursuing an MSc to deepen my technical prowess.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "As a creative developer with a designer's roots, I don't just build websites; I create digital ecosystems. From leading a complete website overhaul as Chief Innovation Officer to boosting brand visibility on Amazon as a Creative Marketing Specialist, I've worn many hats ‚Äì each adding a unique perspective to my craft.",
  aboutParaFour:
    "My toolbox is diverse: Adobe Creative Suite for visual magic, React for seamless interactivity, and data analytics for informed decision-making. But my most powerful tool? The ability to see the big picture while obsessing over the tiniest details.",
  aboutParaFive:
    "I believe in design that doesn't just look good, but feels right. User-centric, intuitive, and with a dash of the unexpected ‚Äì that's my signature style. Whether I'm crafting a brand's visual identity or optimizing a user's journey through a web application, I'm always asking: 'How can this be not just better, but revolutionary?'",
  aboutParaSix:
    "When I'm not immersed in design or debugging code, you might find me exploring the latest in AI and machine learning, or sketching ideas for my next big project. I'm constantly evolving, always learning, and forever fascinated by the endless possibilities at the intersection of design and technology.",
  aboutParaSeven:
    "Let's create something extraordinary together.",
